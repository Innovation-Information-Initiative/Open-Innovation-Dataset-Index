description: Imagine you're analyzing a subset of patents and want to do some text
  analysis of the first independent claim. To do this, you'd need to be able to join
  your list of patent publication numbers with a dataset containing the patent text.
  Additionally, you'd need a method to extract the first claim from the rest of the
  claims. This notebook is a demonstration of one method to perform this analysis
  using python, BigQuery, and Google's new public dataset on patents.

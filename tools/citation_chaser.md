  and Shiny app for forward and backward citations chasing in academic searching.'

description: 'In systematic reviews, we often want to obtain lists of references from
  across studies: forward citation chasing looks for all records citing one or more
  articles of known relevance; backward ciation chasing looks for all records referenced
  in one or more articles. This package contains functions to automate the process
  of forward and backward citation chasing by making use of the Lens.org API. An input
  article list can be used to return a list of all referenced records, and/or all
  citing records in the Lens.org database (consisting of PubMed, PubMed Central, CrossRef,
  Microsoft Academic Graph and CORE; ''https://www.lens.org'').'

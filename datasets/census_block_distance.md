description: 'Census Block Distances are great-circle distances calculated using the
  Haversine formula based on internal points in the geographic area.


  Census Blocks are from Census 2000 SF1 and Census 2010 SF1 files. Census Blocks
  "are statistical areas bounded by visible features, such as streets, roads, streams,
  and railroad tracks, and by nonvisible boundaries, such as selected property lines
  and city, township, school district, and county limits and short line-of-sight extensions
  of streets and roads."'

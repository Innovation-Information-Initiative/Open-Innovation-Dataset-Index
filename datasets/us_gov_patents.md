description: 'The 3PFL database links information on patented inventions and scientific
  publications related to a public procurement contract or a research grant awarded
  by the U.S. Federal Government to detailed contract-level/grant-level information
  (e.g., awarding agency, recipient organization, award size). We have combined data
  from multiple sources, including (but not limited to) the United States Patent and
  Trademark Office bulk database, the Federal Procurement Database System, the Award
  Submission Portal (ASP), and the European Patent Office''s PATSTAT database. We
  also provide a link to the scientific publications associated with these patents.
  The 3PFL database provides rich and original information that opens the door to
  novel empirical research in the economics of innovation and science. '

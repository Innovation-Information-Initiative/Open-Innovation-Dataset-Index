description: 'Improving access to data sets related to transportation economics and
  facilitating research with these datasets are cental objectives of this project.
  Post-doctoral researcher Caitlin Gorback, with advice from from a steering committee
  including Nathaniel Baum-Snow of the University of Toronto, Leah Brooks of George
  Washington University, Edward Glaeser, Harvard University and NBER, Stephen Redding,

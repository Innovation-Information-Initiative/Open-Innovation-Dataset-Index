description: 'Presented here are the tables of quarterly data from Appendix B of "The
  American Business Cycle: Continuity and Change" Edited by Robert J. Gordon. National
  Bureau of Economic Research Studies in Business Cycles Volume 25, Univerisity of
  Chicago Press 1986. For information about sources and methods please see that volume.


  A feature of that volume is an extensive data appendix, compliled as a project independent
  of the conference in collaboration with Nathan S. Balke. The unique value of this
  data set is the fact that it is the only existing source for the pre-1947 quarterly
  data, as NIPA quarterly data series do not otherwise exist before 1947. These files
  include the components of GDP back from 1941 to 1919 and the quarterly real GDP
  back to 1875.'

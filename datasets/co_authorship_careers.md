description: 'The identification enables construction of social networks based on
  patent co-authorship. We will eventually provide descriptive statistics of individual
  and collaborative variables and illustrated examples of networks for an individual,
  an organization, a technology, and a region. The data and code will be publically
  available for community use and improvement and will enable updating as frequently
  as new patents are issued. '

description: The dataset provides geographic coordinates for inventor and applicant
  locations in 18.8 million patent documents spanning over more than 30 years. The
  geocoded data are further allocated to the corresponding countries, regions and
  cities. When the address information was missing in the original patent document,
  we imputed it by using information from subsequent filings in the patent family.
  The resulting database can be used to study patenting activity at a fine-grained
  geographic level without creating bias towards the traditional, established patent
  offices.

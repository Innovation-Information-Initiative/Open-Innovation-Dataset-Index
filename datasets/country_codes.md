description: We present a general method for imputing missing information in the Worldwide
  Patent Statistical Database (PATSTAT) and make the resulting datasets publicly available.
  The PATSTAT database is the de facto standard for academic research using patent
  data. Complete information on patents is essential to obtain an accurate picture
  of technological activities across countries and over time. However, the coverage
  of the database is far from complete. Our data imputation method exploits detailed
  institutional knowledge about the international patent system, and we codify it
  in a SQL algorithm. We provide two datasets related to the imputation of missing
  country codes and missing technology classification. We also release the algorithm
  that can be easily adapted to impute other pieces of information that are missing
  in PATSTAT.

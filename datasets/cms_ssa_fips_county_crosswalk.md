description: 'CMS periodically produces SSA to FIPS CBSA to county crosswalk files.
  They released a CBSA to MSA to FIPS county crosswalk as well. Some CMS data files
  have SSA state and county codes or county name rather than FIPS state and county
  codes. Jean Roth processed the data files below for greater ease of use. '

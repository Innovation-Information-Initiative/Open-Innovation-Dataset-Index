title: Tools for Harmonizing County Boundaries
url: https://elisabethperlman.net/code.html
description: This tool creates the csv tables that allow county boundaries to be synchronized to a base year, exported to the directory you run this from. While this code takes shape files of any type and preforms an intersect, it was written to follow the method used in Hornbeck (2010) (see https://www.dropbox.com/s/1cygkeoo4p89vrw/BWreplication_BorderFixes.rar for those replication files), that is to say, I wrote it to take shapefiles of US counties from NHGIS from a selections of years and then to reapportioning them by area to the boundaries as they were in a base year. The stata code that uses these csvs was writen to be used with Haines' census data (ICPSR 02896).

description: 'Most scientific publishers require authors to submit their manuscripts
  with a text reporting their own parallel activities, including patent-related ones,
  that may be considered as potential Conflict-of-Interest (COI). The authors’ or
  institutional patenting activities disclosed as COI in the official version of the
  article within Conflict-of-Interest Statements (COIS) are generally analysed in
  the literature using either very focused or non-systematic approaches. This study
  proposes methods for assessing COIS presence and main features, particularly with
  respect to patent information, across biomedical topics and journals that are covered
  in the PubMed database for the period 2011-2022.


  The data used for this project is obtained via structured searches of PubMed and
  Scholar Lens, using searches detailed in the documentation.'

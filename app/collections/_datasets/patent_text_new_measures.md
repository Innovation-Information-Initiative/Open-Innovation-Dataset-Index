description: Different open access data files related to the text of USPTO patent
  documents, including 1) for each US patent a list of processed, cleaned and stemmed
  keywords, 2) for each patent a list of the 1,000 most similar patents (based on
  cosine similarity) from the entire population of US patents, 3) for each US patent
  the average cosine similarity with all prior patents from the previous 5 years,
  and the average cosine similarity with all later patents in the following 5 years,
  4) each new keyword (unigram), bigram (sequence of two adjacent keywords), trigram,
  and pairwise keyword combination introduced for the first time in history by a US
  patent, the number of the patent introducing it for the first time, and the total
  number of patents from the entire population using these new keywords, bigrams,
  trigrams, and new keyword combinations.

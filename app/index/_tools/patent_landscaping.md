description: Patent landscaping is the process of finding patents related to a particular
  topic. It is important for companies, investors, governments, and academics seeking
  to gauge innovation and assess risk. However, there is no broadly recognized best
  approach to landscaping. Frequently, patent landscaping is a bespoke human-driven
  process that relies heavily on complex queries over bibliographic patent databases.
  This tool can be used to perform Automated Patent Landscaping, an approach that
  jointly leverages human domain expertise, heuristics based on patent metadata, and
  machine learning to generate high-quality patent landscapes with minimal effort.

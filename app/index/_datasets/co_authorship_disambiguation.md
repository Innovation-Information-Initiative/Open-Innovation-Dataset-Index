description: 'Name disambiguation of US inventors, 1975-2010. Using a Bayesian supervised
  learning approach, we identify individual inventors from the U.S. utility patent
  database, from 1975 to the present. An interface to calculate and illustrate patent
  co-authorship networks and social network measures is also provided. The network
  representation does not require bounding the social network beforehand. We provide
  descriptive statistics of individual and collaborative variables and illustrate
  examples of networks for an individual, an organization, a technology, and a region.
  The paper provides an overview of the technical algorithms and pointers to the data,
  code, and documentation, with the hope of further open development by the research
  community. '

description: This is a human rated contextual phrase to phrase matching dataset focused
  on technical terms from patents. In addition to similarity scores that are typically
  included in other benchmark datasets we include granular rating classes similar
  to WordNet, such as synonym, antonym, hypernym, hyponym, holonym, meronym, domain
  related. The dataset was used in the U.S. Patent Phrase to Phrase Matching competition.

description: 'During the first several decades of its existence, the National Bureau
  of Economic Research (NBER) assembled an extensive data set that covers all aspects
  of the pre-WWI and interwar economies, including production, construction, employment,
  money, prices, asset market transactions, foreign trade, and government activity.
  Many series are highly disaggregated, and many exist at the monthly or quarterly
  frequency. The data set has some coverage of the United Kingdom, France and Germany,
  although it predominantly covers the United States.

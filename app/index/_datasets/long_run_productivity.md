description: The Long-Term Productivity database was created as a project at the Bank
  of France in 2013 by Antonin Bergeaud, Gilbert Cette and Remy Lecat. Following the
  work of Cette, Mairesse and Kocoglu (2009), we extended the database to include
  17 countries in the latest version (2016). The latest version of the database includes
  the following countries -- Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Finland,
  France, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland,
  United Kingdom, United States. We offer data on Total Factor Productivity per hour
  worked, Labor productivity per hour worked, capital intensity and GDP per capita.
  These series cover at least the period 1890 to present annually. In addition, other
  data corresponding to each of the papers linked to this project are available. This
  includes age of capital stock, education attainment, electricity production per
  capita.

description: This tool creates the csv tables that allow county boundaries to be synchronized
  to a base year, exported to the directory you run this from. While this code takes
  shape files of any type and preforms an intersect, it was written to follow the
  method used in Hornbeck (2010) (see https://www.dropbox.com/s/1cygkeoo4p89vrw/BWreplication_BorderFixes.rar
  for those replication files), that is to say, I wrote it to take shapefiles of US
  counties from NHGIS from a selections of years and then to reapportioning them by
  area to the boundaries as they were in a base year. The stata code that uses these
  csvs was writen to be used with Haines' census data (ICPSR 02896).

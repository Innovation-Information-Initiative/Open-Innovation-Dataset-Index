description: 'The project collects all utility patents granted from the Korea Intellectual
  Property Office (KIPO) for the period 1948-2016 and the US Patent and Trademark
  Office (USPTO) for the period 1976-2017. The project also matches their assignees
  to firms in DataGuide 5.0, a Korean financial database. The resulting dataset includes
  total 14,803 listed and non-listed Korean firms matched with their Korean and US
  patents, in addition to a host of accounting and financial information. Over 45%
  of all sample KIPO patents and 87% of US patents assigned to Korean assignees are
  matched. '

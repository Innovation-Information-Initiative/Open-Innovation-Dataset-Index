description: A BERT (bidirectional encoder representation from transformers) model
  pretrained on over 100 million patent publications from the U.S. and other countries
  using open-source tooling. The trained model can be used for a number of use cases,
  including how to more effectively perform prior art searching to determine the novelty
  of a patent application, automatically generate classification codes to assist with
  patent categorization, and autocomplete.

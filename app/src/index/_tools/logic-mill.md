description: 'Logic Mill is a scalable and openly accessible soft- ware system that
  identifies semantically similar documents within either one domain-specific corpus
  or multi-domain corpora. It uses advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques
  to generate numerical representations of documents. Currently it leverages a large
  pre-trained language model to generate these document representations. The system
  focuses on scientific publications and patent documents and contains more than 200
  million documents. It is easily accessible via a simple Application Programming
  Interface (API) or via a web interface. Moreover, it is continuously being updated
  and can be extended to text corpora from other domains. '

description: We demonstrate a machine learning (ML) based approach to estimating claim
  breadth, which has the ability to capture more nuance than a simple word count model.
  While our approach may be an improvement over simpler methods, it is still imperfect
  and does not account for any semantic meaning within the text of the claim. This
  is not intended to be a recommendation on how to measure claim breadth, but instead
  we aim to spark academic and corporate interest in using the large amounts of public
  patent data in BigQuery to further the state of the art in patent research.

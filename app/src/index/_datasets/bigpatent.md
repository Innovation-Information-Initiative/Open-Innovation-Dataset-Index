description: 'BIGPATENT, consisting of 1.3 million records of U.S. patent documents
  along with human written abstractive summaries. Each US patent application is filed
  under a Cooperative Patent Classification (CPC) code.


  Compared to existing summarization datasets, BIGPATENT has the following properties:
  i) summaries contain a richer discourse structure with more recurring entities,
  ii) salient content is evenly distributed in the input, and iii) lesser and shorter
  extractive fragments are present in the summaries. Finally, we train and evaluate
  baselines and popular learning models on BIGPATENT to shed light on new challenges
  and motivate future directions for summarization research.'

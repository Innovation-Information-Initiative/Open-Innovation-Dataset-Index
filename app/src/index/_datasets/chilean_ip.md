description: This study describes patterns and trends of intellectual property (IP)
  use in Chile, drawing on a new database containing all patent, trademark, utility
  model, and design filings received by the Chilean IP office over the period 1991-2010.
  The database provides harmonized applicant names, enabling the unique identification
  of applicants across all four forms of IP. Among other things, the study offers
  insights into the drivers of filing growth, the origin of filings, the distribution
  of applicants, the importance of different applicant types, the share of filings
  by different economic sectors, the relevance of IP bundles, and the patenting behavior
  of Chilean applicants overseas

description: "Each edition of the Orange Book provides a snapshot of unexpired patent
  protection at a moment in time. As patents on a drug expire and new patents are
  issued, these changes are reflected in later editions. The Orange Book also provides
  a snapshot of unexpired regulatory exclusivity granted by the FDA. For example,
  certain novel drugs receive five years of regulatory exclusivity that blocks the
  entry of generic competition, even in the absence of any patents. Combining multiple
  editions reveals a comprehensive picture of patent and regulatory protection as
  it evolves over a drug’s lifecycle. These data files provide digital versions of
  the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)'s Orange Book patent and exclusivity tables
  for years 1985-2016 (no Orange Book was published in 1986). \n\nPDF versions of
  the Orange Books were obtained via a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request,
  and data from these PDF files was either hand-entered or parsed in order to create
  the digital files."

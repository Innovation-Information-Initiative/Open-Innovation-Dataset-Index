description: 'HistPat provides the geography of historical patents granted by the
  United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) from 1790 to 1975. This historical
  dataset is constructed using digitalized records of original patent documents that
  are publicly available. HistPat can be used in different disciplines ranging from
  geography, economics, history, network science, and science and technology studies.
  Additionally, it can easily be merged with post-1975 USPTO digital patent data to
  extend it until today. (2016-05-23) '

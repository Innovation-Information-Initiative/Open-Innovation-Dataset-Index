description: Although the rate of invention by firms and the effect on firm performance
  have been central themes in economics and strategy, the position and differentiation
  of invention by firms have received less attention. We develop a method to characterize
  a firm’s technology portfolio based on the semantic content of patents that allows
  us to map a firm’s unique spatial position relative to every other firm in technology
  space and to measure the overall differentiation of a firm’s technology portfolio.
  Using a large panel of U.S. public firms from 1980 to 2015, we illustrate that technology
  differentiation has a strong positive correlation with firm performance, particularly
  in research and development-intensive industries and industries with strong product
  market rivalry. We also show that technology differentiation is associated with
  subsequent differentiation from competitors in the product market and a reduction
  in outgoing technology spillovers to other firms. We provide open access to code
  and data to characterize the technology portfolio of firms and to measure the technological
  position and differentiation of U.S. public firms.

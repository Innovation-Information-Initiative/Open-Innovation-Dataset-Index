description: 'The World Management Survey is the first cross-country, cross-industry
  dataset built to measure the quality of management practices in establishments.
  The WMS is an interview-based evaluation tool that defines 18 key management practices,
  and scores them from 1 (“worst practice”) to 5 (“best practice”). The evaluation
  focuses on three key areas: First, monitoring: How well do organizations monitor
  what goes on inside the firm, and then use this information for continuous improvement?
  Second, targets: Do organizations set the right targets, track the right outcomes,
  and take appropriate action if the two are inconsistent? Third, incentives/people
  management: Are organizations promoting and rewarding employees based on performance,
  prioritizing careful hiring, and trying to keep their best employees? For more information
  about the dataset and to request access to the identified version of the dataset
  and for further variables, please visit the website https://worldmanagementsurvey.org/'
